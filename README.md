## Admin-Panel:
**Description:** the admin panel is where system administrators view all relevant data on the site. There are three major types of data stored here: applications to the website, existing businesses in the system, and posts in the system. 

**Business Applications Usage:** this interface allows for admin to accept or decline applications based off of clicking the checkmark or the x button. If accepted, the business will then be added to the existing businesses list on the right. If removed, the application is simply removed. Applications can be sorted by both date and name, and can be searched via the search bar.

**Businesses List Usage:** this interface allows for admin to route to the site specific page for businesses or to remove businesses from the site listings. Businesses can be sorted by both date and name, and can be searched via the search bar. Note that as of this phase, all business links are hard coded to go to the Caffeine Corner sample layout.

**Postings Usage:** this interface allows for the admin to manage postings on the site. Here, all postings are listed and can be sorted by name or date, or searched specifically by name. The postings can also be removed.

**Header:** as per all other views, there is a header which routes to the browse page. Login/Signup pages are not accessible as someone viewing this page is already logged in as an admin.

**Other Information:** the admin panel is directly accessed upon logging in as an admin.
